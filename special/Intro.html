    <h1>Who we are?</h1>
    <p> We are Team 5817, the Allen Eagles, a dedicated and passionate group of students from Allen High School 
        committed to excellence in robotics and engineering.<br>
         Our mission is to foster creativity, teamwork,
         and technical skills as we tackle complex challenges in the BEST Robotics competition. Through 
         collaboration and innovation, we strive to inspire one another while building not just robots, 
         but lifelong friendships and leadership abilities. With the support of our mentors and the Allen
          community, we embrace every opportunity to learn, compete, and soar to new heights together!</p>
    <h2>What we do?</h2>
    <p> At Team 5817, we design, build, and program innovative robots to compete in the BEST Robotics 
        competitions. Our journey begins with brainstorming and prototyping, where we leverage our diverse
         skills in engineering, programming, and design. We work collaboratively to create efficient strategies,
          ensuring our robots perform at their best during challenges. Beyond robotics, we engage in outreach activities,
           sharing our passion for STEM with our community and inspiring future generations. Through hands-on learning,
            teamwork, and problem-solving, we not only prepare for competitions but also develop skills that will serve
             us in our future careers.</p>
    <h3> Our other programs.</h3>
    <p>Outside of BEST we offer many other robotics and computer science programs meant to give Allen students a leg up in their
        endeavors academic or otherwise, we offer <b></b>
